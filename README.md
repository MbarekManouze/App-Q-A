The app lacks a some security in back-end side and unfortunatley the subject is not finished. it was fun building such APP THank you for this experience.
to run the APP enter the client dir and run : ( npm install ; npm run start )
enter the sever dir as well and run the script : ./script.sh
The app was built in UBUNTU OS, Hope you wont find any problems when running the app, using docker would have made this easier but time wasn't on my side.
Thanks.
